/* EXERCISE 1
Write the code to execute a SUM between the number 12 and 20
*/

console.log(12+20); 

/* EXERCISE 2
Create a variable named X containing the number 12
*/

let X;
X = 12; 

/* EXERCISE 3
Create a variable named name containing the string John Doe
*/

var name = "John Doe";

/* EXERCISE 4
Execute a DIFFERENCE between the number 12 and the variable X, which stores the value 12
*/
let X = 12;
console.log(12 - X);

/* EXERCISE 5
Create two variables: name1 and name 2. name1 is equal to john, name2 is equal to John.
Verify that name1 is different from name2. 
Verify then, that name1 and name2 are equals if both lowercase (without changing the value of name2)
*/

var name1 = "john";
var name2 = "John";
console.log(name1!==name2)
console.log(name2.toLowerCase())
console.log(name1 === name2.toLowerCase())


/* EXERCISE 6
Create the variable X (value less than 10). Write the code to print the literal value of the given number (ex.: 1 => one, 5 => five)
*/

let x = 2;

if (x === 1) {
    console.log("one");
}   else if (x === 2){
    console.log("two");
}

/* really dont know this one */

/* EXERCISE 7 (EXTRA)
Insert a value in a variable based on the result of a ternary if
*/

let y;

y = x === 3 ? 105 : "anything else";

if (x === 3) {
    y = 195;
} else {
    y = "anything else"
}

/* WRITE YOUR CODE HERE */

/* WHEN YOU ARE FINISHED
Send the code via Slack to the tutor! In the next days we'll also learn how to use GIT
